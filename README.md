# Data Analyst Portfolio by Abdi Adem
Portfolio containing my data analysis projects

 Hi, my name is Abdi Adem. I am interested in pursuing a career in the field of data science. With a degree in Industrial Engineering 
and an interest in analytics, it is only natural that I have a desire to get into data science, as there is quite an overlap between 
engineering and data science with the use of analysis and problem solving.
