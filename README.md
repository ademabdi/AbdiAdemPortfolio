# Portfolio by Abdi Adem
Portfolio containing my data analysis projects

Hi, my name is Abdi Adem. I made this portfolio initially for data analyst projects exclusively, but over time, I have developed interest in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and web design. I look forward to committing project/s that incorporate these topics in the near future.
